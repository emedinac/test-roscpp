# test-roscpp
Simple test codes on ROS and Gazebo for a tentative of SLAM algorithm in a turtlebot
The idea of this repository is recreate some codes available here: 

https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros-projects-exploring-ros-using-2-wheeled-robot-part-1/

### Ideias behind
- Learning ROS on C++ .
- Create default world on Gazebo (launch files).

### Simple algorithms
- reading laser (lidar)
- follow walss
- go to a target point
- obstacle avoidance


### TODO
[ ] Multiple services on C++
[ ] mapping (SLAM)
